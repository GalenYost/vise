Vise is a fast, embeddable, statically typed, compiled programming language.

## General Info

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Vise — no particular reason, just sounds cool |
| **Extension** | `.vz` — shortened from Vise |
| **Syntax** | Mostly C — simple, transparent, nothing hidden or abstracted away |

## Plans on Improving C

- **No header files** — they are meaningless
- **Decorators** — built-in syntax allowing to extend functionality and meaning of anything you want
- **Simple by design** — avoid the complexity of OOP from languages like C++ or Java; if you want it, you keep it simple
- **`defer`** — the dream of C programmers; simplifies code readability while keeping its idea the same
- **Type aliasing** — create standalone types to help develop complex architectures with more readable type names
- **Custom allocations** — a simplified version of `malloc` with optional args for allocation behavior
- **`import`** — since there are no macros, you get a separate keyword to include modules
- **Build scripts/recipes** — the build system should be simple and involve nothing other than the language compiler itself
- **`null` as a type** — allows full compile-time type-safety
- **`comptime`** — mark things evaluable during compilation so functions or expressions can be reduced in the final binary
- **Generics** — C lacks code generation for dynamic types, forcing unsafe `void*` casts; Vise fixes this
- **`std`** — a huge collection of modules; instead of `stdio`/`stdlib`, you import `std.math` and use `std.math.floor`
- **String interpolation** — readable strings without memorizing format flags and their unique features
- **Exports** — `static` won't mean "private to this file", but only that a variable preserves its memory across function calls / different struct instances

## Documentation & Deep Dives

For detailed explanations of Vise's design philosophy and internal features, please check out the `docs/` folder:

*   [Compiler Phases](docs/compiler.md): Step-by-step breakdown of how the Vise compiler works internally.
*   [Grammar](docs/grammar.md): Formal EBNF grammar definitions for the Vise language syntax.
*   [Logging System](docs/logging.md): Overview of the compiler's logging configuration, log levels, and conventions.
*   [Build System](docs/build.md): Details on the nob-based build system (constants, structs, functions).

### Naming
In Vise just like in C you can pretty much do whatever you want, no one will force you to write what is "better", but there are some suggestions that will help in development:

1. **Variables and Functions**:
   - Variables (local and global) should use `snake_case`.
   - Functions should use `snake_case` (e.g., `print_hello()`).

2. **Constants**:
   - Global constants should be named `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
   - Local constants (if contextually small) can be named `snake_case`.

3. **Types and Structs**:
   - Structs, Enums, and Type Aliases should use `PascalCase` (e.g., `AppState`, `HashMap`, `Player`).

4. **Decorators**:
   - Built-in and custom decorators should use `PascalCase` to distinguish them from standard functions (e.g., `@ExportAll`, `@Serializable`).
